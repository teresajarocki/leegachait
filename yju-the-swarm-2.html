Не прерывая традиций Team Fortress, Day of Defeat, Alien Swarm Thursday before last I got a wild swarm on a low branch of a callery pear at my place (NSW Australia). I caught the swarm and it is doing well. Then yesterday there was another smaller swarm in exactly the same place, the same part of the same branch. I had to check the new hive to see if the same swarm had gone back, but it was a different swarm. Did the other swarm leave a pheromone marker? Is this sort of thing common? I caught the new swarm in a temporary box, but the whole thing seems.  Ребята мы тут решили что много кто хочет робуксы??? Так вот если наберём 2к подписчиков я буду сливать ответы на вопросы.

With evade being down-graded in terms of effectiveness and ships having less tokens in general, the Tie swarm is back to being brutally efficient for the points spent. I expect to see a bunch of full on Tie Swarm. Hey guys, I recently re-played the campaign of Gears 2, and noticed that during the COG raid on the hollows, the locust are taking prisoners and torturing them (like dom's wife, Tai and so on) or making them work in camps, or "Processing" them. but mostly we don't really know why they were taking them, even Marcus and Delta are amazed that the Locust have adapted this new strategy. But we don't really know why they are doing this in Gears 2, and no exlpanation is given Timestamps here; https://imgur.com/a/QA0cD Gears 3 Controller  PS4 Controller  Dlink DWA 552 Extreme Wireless N Adapter  Gigabye Windforce GTX 770 0 Intel i7 930 + Gigabyte X58A-UD3R 0 for combo,  for CPU, 100 for mobo Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm Sealed  Everything is in great working condition.
