Just figured this sub would appreciate the anecdote. I was in the produce section picking up bell peppers when all of a sudden I look up and right next to me was Shane McMahon. I knew he lived in my neighborhood but always figured he had a personal shopper. I regret marking out but I did and blurted out something and pointed to my t shirt. I happen to be wearing a Kofi shirt today. He was very nice , asked my name , and offered out his hand to shake mine and said his name was Shane. –ò–≥—Ä–∞—Ç—å –≤ –∏–≥—Ä—É Personal Shopper 5 –æ–Ω–ª–∞–π–Ω –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ. –ü–æ –º–µ—Ä–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–µ–π —Ç—ã –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –º–æ–∂–µ—à—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å –¥–µ–≤—É—à–∫—É, –Ω–æ —Ç—ã –ø–æ–º–æ–∂–µ—à—å –µ–π –Ω–∞–ª–∞–¥–∏—Ç—å –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å –≤—ã–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º.
